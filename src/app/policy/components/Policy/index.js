          UpLyft Financial is a California corporation. UpLyft Financial is a
          marketing lead generator and loan match referral service. UpLyft
          Financial DOES NOT take secured or unsecured or any mortgage
          applications, originate, service, make loans or credit decisions in
          connection with loans. Nor does UpLyft Financial underwrite or fund
          secured or unsecured loans. UpLyft Financial’s services are only
          administrative. Any loan inquiry you submit is NOT an application for
          credit with UpLyft Financial. Rather, it is an inquiry to be matched
          with Lenders or debt relief professionals to receive conditional
          offers from fully Licensed Lenders or applicable Debt Relief
          Professionals. You may have to complete an application with a Lender
          or a Debt Relief Professional before they will extend an offer. A
          Lender or debt relief professional you select may ask you to agree to
          their terms and conditions prior to finalizing an offer with them. The
          Lender or applicable debt relief Professional, not UpLyft Financial,
          will determine the amount of any such fee and should be disclosed
          prior to consumption. Fees are never payable to UpLyft Financial.
          UpLyft Financial charges zero fees to its clients directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          UpLyft Financial is strictly a channel for consumers to explore their
          options with other licensed professionals for the services they
          consider using. Ultimately the consumer assumes all responsibility for
          the selection of Lender or debt relief professional and understands
          the outcome of those transactions is not the responsibility of UpLyft
          Financial Inc. The client acknowledges they would agree to outside
          company contract terms and conditions, not UpLyft Financial’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as otherwise provided for your state, UpLyft Financial is not
          an agent of you or any Lender or Debt Relief Professional. You should
          rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product,
          terms and Lender or debt relief Professional that best suits your
          personal financial circumstances. The Lender or debt relief
          Professional is solely responsible for its services to you, and you
          agree that UpLyft Financial shall not be liable for any damages or
          costs of any type arising out of, or in any way connected with, your
          use of such services. You understand that Lenders or debt relief
          Professionals may keep your requests information and any other
          information provided by UpLyft Financial or received by them in the
          processing of your loan request or other services, whether or not you
          are qualified for a loan or other services with them or if you make a
          loan or execute other services with them. In addition, UpLyft
          Financial may receive personally identifiable information regarding
          the disposition of your loan or other debt relief transactions from
          the Lender or debt relief Professional in order to fulfill its
          regulatory requirements as well as for internal business purposes. You
          agree to notify any particular Lender or debt relief Professional
          directly if you no longer want to receive communications.
        </p>
        <h2>Licensed Affiliates</h2>
        <p>
          All Lenders or debt relief agencies we may refer you to are required
          to be fully licensed, accredited and compliant with all applicable
          state and federal laws. Any lender or licensed professional you choose
          will be the party servicing your debt not UpLyft Financial.
        </p>
        <h2>Credit:</h2>
        <p>
          Any application request you submit is NOT an application for credit.
          Rather, it is a request to be matched with Lenders or licensed
          Professionals to receive conditional offers from Lenders or
          Professionals. You may have to complete a full application directly
          with a Lender before they will extend an unconditional loan or other
          applicable offers.

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
          **Please note that all calls with the company may be recorded or
          monitored for quality assurance and training purposes. Clients who
          make all their monthly program payments pay approximately 50% of their
          enrolled balance before fees, or 68% to 85% including fees, over 24 to
          48 months. Not all clients are able to complete our program for
          various reasons, including their ability to save sufficient funds. Our
          estimates are based on our own professional experience and prior
          achieved results, which will vary depending on your specific
          circumstances. We do not guarantee that your debts will be resolved
          for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific period of
          time. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to your
          creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or
          credit repair services. Our service is not available in all states and
          our fees may vary from state to state. Please contact a tax
          professional to discuss potential tax consequences of less than full
          balance debt resolution. Read and understand all program materials
          prior to enrollment. The use of debt settlement services will likely
          adversely affect your creditworthiness, which may result in you being
          subject to collections or being sued by creditors or collectors and
          may increase the outstanding balances of your enrolled accounts due to
          the accrual of fees and interest. However, negotiated settlements we
          obtain on your behalf resolve the entire account, including all
          accrued fees and interest.
